## tl;dr
ðŸ”¸ Clone it
ðŸ”¸ Adjust it to your needs
ðŸ”¸ Test it
ðŸ”¸ Deploy it

## Usage
Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/brunopadz/simple-backup-to-s3.git
```

Adjust all parameters on `src/240min.sh` and `src/daily.sh`. Don't worry, everything is commented.

Use `utils/crontab` file to guide you how to setup your crontab :)

## Why
I've created these scripts to backup SAP HANA backup files to S3 and decided to open source the solution.
Because, why not?

### TODO
* Add more crontab examples
